Description: Estimate joint longitudinal and time-to-event models under a Bayesian
    framework via Stan. Stan is a C++ library for Bayesian estimation. Users of the
    rstanjm package specify a joint model using the customary R formula syntax
    and customary R data frames. The rstanjm package then carries out back-end 
    estimation in Stan via the 'rstan' package (the R interface for Stan). 
    Univariate (one longitudinal marker) or multivariate (more than one longitudinal 
    marker) joint models are allowed. The longitudinal outcome(s) are each modelled 
    using a generalised linear mixed model. Dependence between multiple longitudinal
    outcomes is captured via a shared multivariate normal distribution for the 
    random effects. Continuous, binary or count data can be handled in the 
    longitudinal submodel via a range of link functions and error distributions. 
    Multilevel clustered data (for example, patients within clinics) can be 
    accomodated in the longitudinal submodel only. The time-to-event is modelled 
    using a proportional hazards model for which the baseline hazard can be 
    specified as a Weibull distribution, piecewise constant, or approximated 
    using B-splines. The association structure for the joint model can be 
    specified in a variety of ways, for example, by having the log hazard of the 
    event linearly associated with the current value of the longitudinal 
    marker, current slope of the longitudinal marker, or shared random effects.  
    Various options are available for the prior distributions of the regression 
    coefficients.
